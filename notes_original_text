To get original text of a retweeted tweet:

look at field:
- retweeted_status -> text and entities


We want all of the retweets to use this information instead of the retweeted text.
i.e.:

tweets['text'] = map(lambda tweet: tweet.get("retweeted_status", tweet).get("text", {}), tweets_data)

This works.

Output:

We're going to want only one datapoint per tweet (i.e. not count multiple retweets.)

Track the "id" variable of the tweet (or retweet).
tweets['tw_id'] = map(lambda tweet: tweet.get("retweeted_status", tweet).get("id", {}), tweets_data)

                                                    text               tw_id

Note that the ID of 3 and 4 are the same.

If we look at the number of retweets for only this tweet:
index    id                   retweets
3   642226614462365696        13
4   642226614462365696        13
6   642226614462365696        13
7   642226614462365696        13
8   642226614462365696        13
10  642226614462365696        13
11  642226614462365696         9
21  642226614462365696        13

we see that they're not identical. Some users retweeted different versions. We only want the maximum.
To do that: select the subset with max retweets, and then select the first one (minimum index). Doesn't actually matter which one we select.

Possible problem: We're probing an instant in time, but the number of retweets keeps increasing as time goes by.
To check how much a problem this is, we can plot the number of retweets vs some kind of timestamp.

Here's a graph showing that 12 hours is about the time it takes to saturate:

How do we find the length of the text minus all of the entities?
Any url used in the tweet is also listed in the entities, along with its extended url. e.g:
"urls":[{"url":"http:\/\/t.co\/qM50i57jU1",...
This means we can count the total characters in each url and subtract it... right? Maybe if the url is shorter it keeps the shorter url but still charges 22/23 characters...
For now, just add up the characters.

I'm asking the wrong question about hashtags! If you compare all non-hashtag to all hashtag, the latter group is larger.
