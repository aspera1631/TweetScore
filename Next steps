Next steps:

To prepare for machine learning;
- do some exploration
	- rts vs favories
	- rts vs followers
	- rts vs following
	- followers vs following
	- histogram of text lengths
	- filter for english and check these trends

- gather more data




Some thoughts about features:
- should look at text length independent of hashtags, http, and other stuff.
- can just use followers as a feature and look at how important it is.
	- need to check whether the follower count changes the functional form of other dependencies. if so, we just take an average.
- look at length of hashtags and mentions
- check twitter for policy on https, images.
- Is there an easy way to look at tweet frequency?

What is it possible to change in a single tweet?
- number of hts
- number of user mentions
- number of characters (Total)
- number of non-ht, non-user characters
- url presence
- pic presence
- type of pic
- insta or twitter pic
- emoji
- punctuation
- sentiment
- digit
- quote
- vid url
- photo url


Could we do it automatically?

http uses 22 chars
https and images count as 23 chars

If retweeted, it may be truncated. Can recover the original text in retweet_status

A URL of any length will be altered to 22 characters, even if the link itself is less than 22 characters long. Your character count will reflect this.

Look at all tweets that do not contain hashtags, user mentions, links. Plot retweets vs length. Then look at tweets with one url, plot retweets vs length not including url.


How do we look at retweets vs length for tweets with no entities? Problem: when something is RTd, it embeds the original user as an entity. Of those tweets that are retweets, look at the retweet_info whatever. Check whether that has any entities. FIrst we should check whether there are any tweets that have no entities.
